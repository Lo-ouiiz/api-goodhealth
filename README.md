# GoodHealth API  

*[Lire en français 🇫🇷](README_FR.md)*

As part of my final project for the **BUT Multimedia and Internet Professions** program, I developed a **PHP API** to serve as the backend for the **GoodHealth** application, a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** dedicated to **health and wellness tracking**.  

This API enables **user management**, **data recording and retrieval** (weight, sleep, hydration). It also ensures secure access using **JWT authentication** and communicates with a **MySQL database**.  

## 📅 Project Timeline  
This project was completed in **March 2024**, at the end of my MMI program.  

## 📌 Features  
- **User management** (registration, login, JWT authentication)  
- **CRUD operations** for weight, sleep, and hydration data

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **PHP**  
- **MySQL**  
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token for authentication)
